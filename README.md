#### Abstract  

<div style="text-align: justify">  
Conversion of nature into agricultural land is a major driver of environmental change globally. However, the spatial resolution of current global land change models is relatively coarse and does not capture fine-grained patterns relevant for quantifying local impacts. To fill this gap, we created global suitability maps for conversion into agricultural land at a resolution of 10 arc-seconds (~300 meters at the equator). To that end, we developed Artificial Neural Network models relating locations of conversions into agricultural land, as recorded from 2003 to 2013, to various explanatory variables reflecting topography, climate, soil and accessibility. Cross-validation of the models indicated good performance with a mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.95. Hindcasting from 1992 to 2002 revealed a similar performance (AUC = 0.94), indicating that our models are robust when applied to a different temporal context. Our high-resolution land suitability maps can be used to project future expansion of agricultural land worldwide, which is an asset for global environmental assessment studies.
